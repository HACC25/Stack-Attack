## IMPORTANT 

To test our public demo, end users must allow insecure HTTP requests. Vercel blocks these by default, and our server runs on HTTP.

To get around this, you must allow insecure settings by going to "Site Settings" > "Insecure content" > "allow".

1) Click the configuration button by the URL. This may not say "Not Secure", but api requests are still being blocked, and the following steps still must be followed.

2) Click Site Settings

3) Change insecure content from "block" to "allow"

We apologize for the inconvenience as switching to HTTPS requires obtaining an SSL/TLS Certificate, which we were unaware of.
